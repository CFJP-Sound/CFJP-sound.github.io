    "Two students of the arts and sciences, Corey Ferris and Jayson Perkins have spent the last decade forging their friendship and creative endeavors. Both have been lifelong audio and video enthusiasts, manifesting in recent years through a number of projects.",
    "Corey has spent no shortage of time immersed in the world of music production. Even as a listener, he's had years absorbing influences and styles from his biggest inspirations. His insight on rhythmic structures and drum composition come from countless sessions in the lab and at venues. In addition, he's a self taught video editor, and has made several reels and montages for his local gaming scene.",
    "Jayson is an unapologetic disciple of the synth and all things sinister. After experiencing the raw power behind some of his favorite artists playing live, he was nothing but energized. He aims to push what is considered 'groovy' or 'danceable' with his signature rough and heavy sound design. He dove into music production with an unwavering focus, and one goal - that the listener would never forget what they just heard.",
    "Corey and Jayson continue to work on new music and video releases, bringing gritty bass, ethereal beats, and fantastic soundscapes wherever they go. They hope to weave these mediums in new ways to fascinate and excite their audience."
